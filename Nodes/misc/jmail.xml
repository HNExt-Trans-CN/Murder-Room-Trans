和往常一样，是时候考虑另一种情况了。你知道该怎么做。 检查您的案例文件以了解案例详细信息。

Sterling的案子再次被揭开，这意味着是时候让事情揭开来了。
我需要您做的就是连接负责人的起搏器。时间至关重要。
现在是时候一劳永逸地揭露Nova的过犯了。

你的威胁对我来说毫无意义。</email>

With his death, Nova should be scrambling to pin someone as a suspect. They have no reason
to suspect you, however they will be going after me.
Before I leave, you should know I've finally decrypted the ET-5 case. Finally the truth about these bastards will be revealed.

现在该结束了。</email>
<email recipient="NovaDirector" sender="Hilda Riegan" subject="Re: 更换监督员">Understood, sir.
I will oversee Agent #PLAYERNAME# for the time being. However, I do wonder, am I really best suited for this task? Couldn't you ask one of the other overseers?

<email recipient="NovaDirector" sender="Luke Skylar" subject="月例探员报告">Good day, sir,
Attached is the latest report on all currently active Nova agents. Please look through the report at your earliest convenience.

<email recipient="NovaDirector" sender="EnTech International" subject="合约更新 2020">Greetings, George
As you are aware, EnTech has recently pushed an update to its investigation suite. As you rely on this partnership, we have felt these
recent developments require an update to our original agreement. We believe this will benefit both of our organizations.

Yours sincerely,
